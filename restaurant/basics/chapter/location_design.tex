The location of a restaurant can make or break its success. Similarly, the design and ambiance play crucial roles in creating the dining experience. This chapter follows Sue and Owen as they search for the perfect location and design a space that reflects their concept.

\section{The Search for the Perfect Location | 寻找完美位置 | Die Suche nach dem perfekten Standort}

Sue and Owen spent three months searching for the ideal location. They knew that location was one of the most critical decisions they would make, affecting everything from foot traffic to operating costs.

\subsection{Location Criteria}

They established clear criteria for their location search:

    \item Safe, well-lit area
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Demographics and Foot Traffic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Target demographic presence
    \item Daytime and evening foot traffic

\subsection{Location Evaluation Process | 选址评估流程 | Standortbewertungsprozess}

For each potential location, Sue and Owen created an evaluation matrix:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Score (1-10)} \\
\midrule
Visibility & 15\% & \\
Accessibility & 15\% & \\
Foot traffic & 20\% & \\
Demographics match & 15\% & \\
Size and layout & 10\% & \\
Rent and terms & 15\% & \\
Competition & 10\% & \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{100\%} & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Location Evaluation Matrix}
\end{table}
